# JavaScript vs TypeScript Example
This is just a simple project I created to display some differences between JavaScript and TypeScript. These projects don't follow great standards, but they are fairly simple and show off a number of coding styles and how typing can improve the developer experience.

Both projects will start by running "npm start" in their root directories. The PostMan collection provided will work for both repos, update the API_URL variable from 8080 to 8081 to test the TypeScript codebase instead of the JavaScript.
